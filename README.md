## General info

The app has four main features:
- Create a new topic
- Create a new deck
- See the current decks and delete them
- Play with the decks

The user can create a deck, with how many cards he wishes, of a certain topic. This topic can also be created by the user. The user can play with the deck too to see how many cards he remembers. At the end of a game, the app shows a report based on the feedback of the user throught the game.
